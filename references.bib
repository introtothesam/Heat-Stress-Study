  abstract = {The heat hypothesis states that hot temperatures can increase aggressive motives and behaviors. Although alternative explanations occasionally account for some portion of the observed increases in aggression when temperatures are high, none are sufficient to account for most such heat effects. Hot temperatures increase aggression by directly increasing feelings of hostility and indirectly increasing aggressive thoughts. Results show that global warming trends may well increase violent-crime rates. Better climate controls in many institutional settings (e.g., prisons, schools, the workplace) may reduce aggression-related problems in those settings.},

  abstract = {It is observed that hot weather and violence go hand in hand. This fact can be derived from a variety of sources, from a variety of centuries, and from a variety of continents. The first major review of the empirical literature on temperature effects on aggression relied on two epistemological strategies---namely, triangulation and meta-analysis. However, this chapter considers a third strategy the aggression hypothesis, parsimony. The temperature-aggression hypothesis includes the theoretical statement that uncomfortable temperatures cause increase in aggressive motivation, and under the right conditions, in aggressive behavior. The heat hypothesis refers more specifically to the hot side of this hypothesis and is the most widely studied version. The heat effect refers to the empirical observation of an increase in aggressive behavior in hot temperatures. It is noted that people believe that hot temperatures increase feelings of anger and hostility, decrease alertness and energy, and increase aggression and violence. Cold temperatures exhibit exactly the opposite effects.},

In Exp I, with 35 undergraduates, Ss received either a positive or negative evaluation from a confederate and were then provided with an opportunity to aggress against this person by means of electric shock. On the basis of previous research, it was predicted that high ambient temperatures (92-95 Deg.F) would facilitate aggression by those receiving positive evaluations but actually inhibit such behavior by those receiving negative assessments. Results confirm both predictions and also indicate that more moderate but still uncomfortably warm temperatures (82-85 Deg.F) produced similar effects. Exp II, with 64 male undergraduates, employed procedures similar to Exp I and examined the suggestion that administration of a cooling drink would reduce the impact of high ambient temperatures upon overt aggression. This prediction, too, was confirmed. The possible mediating role of negative affect with respect to the influence of ambient temperature and other environmental factors upon aggression is discussed.

In particular, it is unknown whether the rate of suicide, a leading cause of death globally, is systematically affected by climatic conditions. Using comprehensive data from multiple decades for both the United States and Mexico, we find that suicide rates rise 0.7\% in US counties and 2.1\% in Mexican municipalities for a 1\,{$^\circ$}C increase in monthly average temperature. This effect is similar in hotter versus cooler regions and has not diminished over time, indicating limited historical adaptation. Analysis of depressive language in {$>$}600 million social media updates further suggests that mental well-being deteriorates during warmer periods. We project that unmitigated climate change (RCP8.5) could result in a combined 9--40 thousand additional suicides (95\% confidence interval) across the United States and Mexico by 2050, representing a change in suicide rates comparable to the estimated impact of economic recessions, suicide prevention programmes or gun restriction laws.},

  abstract = {Objective We created the Daily Sessions, Frequency, Age of Onset, and Quantity of Cannabis Use Inventory (DFAQ-CU) because the current lack of psychometrically sound inventories for measuring these dimensions of cannabis use has impeded research on the effects of cannabis in humans. Method A sample of 2,062 cannabis users completed the DFAQ-CU and was used to assess the DFAQ-CU's factor structure and reliability. To assess validity, a subsample of 645 participants completed additional measures of cannabis dependence and problems (Marijuana Smoking History Questionnaire [MSHQ], Timeline Followback [TLFB], Cannabis Abuse Screening Test [CAST], Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test Revised [CUDIT-R], Cannabis Use Problems Identification Test [CUPIT], and Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test [AUDIT]). Results A six-factor structure was revealed, with factors measuring: daily sessions, frequency, age of onset, marijuana quantity, cannabis concentrate quantity, and edibles quantity. The factors were reliable, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from .69 (daily sessions) to .95 (frequency). Results further provided evidence for the factors' convergent (MSHQ, TLFB), predictive (CAST, CUDIT-R, CUPIT), and discriminant validity (AUDIT). Conclusions The DFAQ-CU is the first psychometrically sound inventory for measuring frequency, age of onset, and quantity of cannabis use. It contains pictures of marijuana to facilitate the measurement of quantity of marijuana used, as well as questions to assess the use of different forms of cannabis (e.g., concentrates, edibles), methods of administering cannabis (e.g., joints, hand pipes, vaporizers), and typical THC levels. As such, the DFAQ-CU should help facilitate research on frequency, quantity, and age of onset of cannabis use.},

The GAM is a dynamic, social--cognitive, developmental model that provides an integrative framework for domain-specific aggression theories. It includes situational, personological, and biological variables. The GAM draws heavily on social--cognitive and social learning theories that have been developed over the past 40 years by social, personality, cognitive, and developmental psychologists. The chapter is organized into seven sections. First, we offer definitions of antisocial, aggressive, and violent behavior. Second, we provide a brief description of the GAM. Third, we discuss the dynamic process by which personological and situational factors establish and sustain aggression: the violence escalation cycle. Fourth, we use the GAM to understand how seemingly ordinary citizens become terrorists, suicide bombers, torturers, and other doers of aggression and violence. Fifth, we discuss the implications of the GAM for aggression between groups of people. Sixth, we apply the GAM to show how certain government actions designed to promote peace can increase aggression and violent behavior. Seventh, we discuss useful suggestions based on the GAM regarding ways to reduce aggression and violence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Emotions and temperature are closely related through embodied processes, and people seem to associate temperature concepts with emotions. While this relationship is often evidenced by everyday language (e.g., cold and warm feelings), what remains missing to date is a systematic study that holistically analyzes how and why people associate specific temperatures with emotions. The present research aimed to investigate the associations between temperature concepts and emotion adjectives on both explicit and implicit levels. In Experiment 1, we evaluated explicit associations between twelve pairs of emotion adjectives derived from the circumplex model of affect, and five different temperature concepts ranging from 0{$^\circ$}C to 40{$^\circ$}C, based on responses from 403 native speakers of four different languages (English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese). The results of Experiment 1 revealed that, across languages, the temperatures were associated with different regions of the circumplex model. The 0{$^\circ$}C and 10{$^\circ$}C were associated with negative-valanced, low-arousal emotions, while 20{$^\circ$}C was associated with positive-valanced, low-to-medium-arousal emotions. Moreover, 30{$^\circ$}C was associated with positive-valanced, high-arousal emotions; and 40{$^\circ$}C was associated with high-arousal and either positive- or negative-valanced emotions. In Experiment 2 (N = 102), we explored whether these temperature-emotion associations were also present at the implicit level, by conducting Implicit Association Tests (IATs) with temperature words (cold and hot) and opposing pairs of emotional adjectives for each dimension of valence (Unhappy/Dissatisfied vs. Happy/Satisfied) and arousal (Passive/Quiet vs. Active/Alert) on native English speakers. The results of Experiment 2 revealed that participants held implicit associations between the word hot and positive-valanced and high-arousal emotions. Additionally, the word cold was associated with negative-valanced and low-arousal emotions. These findings provide evidence for the existence of temperature-emotion associations at both explicit and implicit levels across languages.},

Before starting the cognitive assessment, subjects completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and provided subjective measures of thermal comfort and thermal sensation. Our results showed that while simple tasks were not affected, complex cognitive task performance was significantly reduced in the HOT. Furthermore, although subjects responded faster during the complex task (OTS) they took longer to find the correct solution. Within the 15~min of heat exposure, skin temperature (Tskin) significantly increased by {$\sim$}3~{$^\circ$}C. However, core temperature remained unchanged and there were cortical excitability alterations that could have influenced cognitive performance. Therefore, the increase in Tskin appears to be a sufficient physiological response to alter the subjective state of individuals and impair effective decision-making that could have important consequences in occupational settings.},

Data were analyzed using a generalized additive model, adjusting for confounding factors such as sunshine, relative humidity, holidays, and long-term trends.

We observed a 1.4\% increase (95\% confidence interval=1.0--1.7\%) in suicide with each 1{$^\circ$}C-increase in daily mean temperature. The suicide risks related to the temperature for males, elderly people, and those with less education were higher than for females, younger people, and those with more education, respectively. These findings have confirmed that temperature is associated with suicide in Korea and further our understanding of more susceptible groups, the effects of gender, age, and education level. Therefore, temperature, one of the meteorological factors, is an important risk factor on suicide.},

Methods: We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover analysis based on conditional logistic regression to control for relevant covariates. The exposure-response curve was explored, and stratified analyses were conducted by season and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: The overall risk of assault deaths significantly increased by 1.4\% per 1{$^\circ$}C increase in ambient temperature. A positive curvilinear relationship was observed between ambient temperature and assault deaths, which flattened out at 23.6{$^\circ$}C during the warm season. Furthermore, risk increases were higher in males, teenagers, and those with the least education. Conclusion: This study highlighted the importance of understanding the impact of rising temperatures on aggression in the context of climate change and public health.},

On the other hand the relationship between the responses to mental stress and individual personality is well documented. The aim of this study was then to find if personality traits have some influence on the responses to environmental temperature exposure. A group of 20 young adults were exposed for 90 min to cold (10 {$^\circ$}C) while skin temperature (Ts), oxygen consumption and discomfort rating were recorded. In a second experiment they were exposed to heat (40 {$^\circ$}C) for 90 min when the sweat rate and the discomfort rating were recorded. Prior to these tests the Big Five Personality Test was used to measure the personality traits of the subjects. The results show significant negative correlation between neuroticism and the O2 consumed, the discomfort rating and Ts for the test in the cold, while extraversion was positively related to O2 consumption but not to Ts and discomfort rating. In response to heat, neuroticism predominance was associated with greater discomfort, reduced tolerance and diminished sweat rate. The discomfort rating, in this case, was negatively related to extraversion. It is proposed that the reduced O2 consumption in the cold and the lower rate of sweating in the heat observed with neuroticism, are caused by enhanced activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Further investigation is required to assess the validity of this proposal. Overall, the present investigation shows that physical environmental stresses, in common with mental stress, could be in some ways related to personality traits.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of thermal stress on cognitive function among workers in a hot industry. Methods: In this cross-sectional study conducted in Malibel Saipa Company in 2013, workers were assigned into two groups: one group were exposed to heat stress (n=35), working in casting unit and the other group working in machin\-ing unit (n=35) with a normal air conditioning. Wet Bulb Globe Temperature was measured at three heights of ankle, abdomen, and head. In order to evalu\-ate the effects of heat stress on attention and reaction time, Stroop tests 1, 2, and 3 were conducted before starting the work and during the work. Results: A significant positive correlation was observed between WBGT and test duration (P=0.01) and reaction time of Stroop test 3 (P=0.047), and be\-tween number of errors in Stroop tests 1, 2, and 3, during the work (P= 0.001). Moreover, Stroop test 3 showed a significant higher score for both test dura\-tion and reaction time of workers in case group. Conclusion: Results of the present study, conducted in a real work environ\-ment, confirmed the impairment of cognitive functions, including selective at\-tention and reaction time, under heat stress conditions.},

  abstract = {A lack of self-control has long been theorized to predict an individual's likelihood to engage in antisocial behaviors. However, existing definitions of self-control encompass multiple psychological constructs and lab-based measures of aggression have not allowed for the examination of aggression upon provocation where self-control is needed most. We introduce two versions of a novel paradigm, the Retaliate or Carry-on: Reactive AGgression Experiment (RC-RAGE) to fill this methodological gap. Using large online samples of US adults (N = 354 and N = 366), we evaluate to what extent dispositional impulsivity, self-control, aggression, and state anger contribute to aggression upon provocation when there is a financial cost involved. Results showed that costly retaliation on this task was related to trait aggression and being in an angry emotional state, but not related to social desirability. Importantly, we show that the tendency to act impulsively is a better predictor of costly retaliation than other forms of self-control, such as the ability to delay gratification, resist temptation, or plan ahead. As a browser-based task, the RC-RAGE provides a tool for the future investigation of reactive aggression in a variety of experimental settings.},

Exploratory principal components analysis of the items identified six primary factors and three second-order factors. The three second-order factors were labeled Attentional Impulsiveness, Motor Impulsiveness, and Nonplanning Impulsiveness. Two of the three second-order factors identified in the BIS-11 were consistent with those proposed by Barratt (1985), but no cognitive impulsiveness component was identified per se. The results of the present study suggest that the total score of the BIS-11 is an internally consistent measure of impulsiveness and has potential clinical utility for measuring impulsiveness among selected patient and inmate populations.},

Results Heat stress measurements ranged from 23.8\,{$^\circ$}C~-- 42\,{$^\circ$}C. More than 50\,\% of the workers had high sweat rate (\&gt;1.2\,L/h) when exposed to high environmental temperatures. Positive correlation was obtained between WBGT, sweat rate and reaction time which indicates that hyperthermia has an impact on neural network processing. Heart rate and reaction time also increased with rise in WBGT and heavy physical activity. Conclusions There was impairment of cognitive functions (reaction time) under heat stress conditions. Hence, reaction time can be used to assess the short-term impact of heat stress on neural modulation and will help to plan effective intervention strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality among workers.},

By focusing on recent temperature variability, we attempt to estimate one important dimension of climate change's impact on violent crime by exploring associations between sudden temperature swings and the incidence of violence. We also explore whether sudden upward temperature anomalies have stronger positive impacts on violent crime in the coldest months of the year due to routine activities changes. Methods This study explores the association between sudden temperature anomalies (both upward and downward) and the daily incidence of homicide, robbery, and aggravated assault in 28~U.S. cities from 2015 to 2021 using multivariable two-way fixed-effects negative binomial panel regression models. Results We find temperature volatility is significantly associated with the incidence of violence. Upward departures in temperature are associated with increases in robbery and homicide, while downward departures are associated in the opposite direction. These associations are more robust in winter, with unexpectedly warmer winter weather associated with larger increases in robbery. Conclusions Results support the hypotheses and routine activities theory. We discuss the findings in the context of under-explored criminological consequences of climate change.},

This scoping review aims to examine the current state of the existing literature concerning the potential relationship between substance abuse and climate change, along with the aspects it encompasses. Material and methods: The review followed PRISMA guidelines for methodological rigor, aiming to identify studies on drug abuse. Searches were conducted across the primary databases using specific search strings. Quality assessment involved evaluating the research question's clarity, search strategy transparency, consistency in applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and reliability of data extraction. Results: Most studies were conducted in the USA. They included observational and retrospective quantitative studies, as well as qualitative and prospective observational ones. Research examined the correlation between extreme weather and some substance abuse. All studies analyzed the adverse effects of climate change, especially heatwaves, on both physiological and pathological levels. Conclusions: The scoping review notes the scarcity of studies about the correlation between substance abuse and climate change, and emphasizes the threats faced by individuals with substance abuse and mental health disorders due to climate change.}

Then, 18 participants with different thermal preferences (6 for each thermal preference) were selected from 180 university students based on the proposed questionnaire. Finally, the 18 participants performed human trials in three environments (21~{$^\circ$}C, 19~{$^\circ$}C, and 17~{$^\circ$}C) wherein physiological parameters (core temperature, heart rate, skin temperature, and conductive heat flux), as well as thermal sensation and thermal comfort, were recorded during tests. The results demonstrated that the proposed questionnaire can be used to evaluate thermal preferences. Furthermore, thermal preferences significantly (p~{$<~$}0.05) affected physiological parameters and thermal sensation. In particular, the participants who preferred cool temperatures had lower mean skin temperature, heart rate, and thermal comfort vote but higher mean conductive heat flux and thermal sensation votes than the warm preferred participants. The rates of the mean skin temperature and core temperature decline in the cool preferred participants were lower than in the warm preferred participants.
